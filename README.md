# GameDataStream
A subclass of [QDataStream](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qdatastream.html) intended to make handling video game assets easier.

Changes include the following:
* Adds platform-based endianness differentiation
* Adds platform-based 32/64 bit pointer length differentiation
* Adds read/write support for pointers, size_t, and strings (both fixed-length and null-terminated)
* Makes [QIODevice](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qiodevice.html)'s `seek()`, `peek()`, `pos()`, `open()`, and `close()` available without calling `device()`
* Adds `skip()` for arbitrary-length skips (based on `QIODevice::seek()`â€”`QIODevice::skip()` behaves differently)
* Overloads `readRawData()` to read into another DataStream's device (useful for maintaining a buffer with unknown data and/or padding)

This is by no means perfect or complete, but it's done everything I need it to so far. If someone else ends up using this, feel free to open a pull request with any changes you want added.
